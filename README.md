# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate

## About
The [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) is an intensive, hands-on program designed to develop practical expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Through a series of in-depth courses and real-world projects, I built machine learning models, developed deep learning architectures, and created generative AI solutions using industry-standard tools and frameworks. The program emphasized end-to-end problem-solving in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and recommender systems, culminating in capstone projects that showcase advanced AI engineering capabilities.

### Skills Acquired:
- Built machine learning models with Python and Scikit-Learn for tasks including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
- Designed and trained deep learning models using Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, including CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and autoencoders.
- Developed and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) and generative AI applications with Hugging Face and LangChain.
- Applied AI techniques to real-world scenarios in NLP, computer vision, and recommender systems.
- Implemented prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning.
- Automated and deployed AI pipelines, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.

Earning this certificate and the accompanying IBM digital badge demonstrates my ability to deliver robust AI solutions as an AI Engineer.
